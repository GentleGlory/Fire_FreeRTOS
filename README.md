# Fire_FreeRTOS

This repository contains the implementation of exercises from the book ***[[野火]FreeRTOS 内核实现与应用开发实战—基于STM32](https://doc.embedfire.com/rtos/freertos/zh/latest/index.html)***. 

## 📘 Book Overview
This book is the FreeRTOS version of the **RTOS内核实现与应用开发实战指南**, and a sister volume to the *RT-Thread* edition. Both books share a similar structure, writing style, and cover common RTOS theoretical concepts. However, they differ in kernel implementation, source code, and API usage, which are the core focus areas.

The book has two parts:

1. **Building FreeRTOS from Scratch** – Covers RTOS fundamentals and kernel development.
2. **FreeRTOS Application Development** – Focuses on FreeRTOS components, source code, and APIs.
